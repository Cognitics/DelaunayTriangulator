	\brief Subdivision
 
	Provides a class for storing Edges and Vertex points assossiated with a quad-edge system. 
	Assigns unique IDs to all Vertices and Edges  and stores them in lists using they ID values as index values into the lists. 
	Automatically cleans up and used memory by all Vertices and Edges owned by it upon destruction.
	Stores Edges and Vertices as blocks of data. When an Edge or Vertex is "deleted" it it instead flagged as inactive
	and that memory will be used to construct future Edges/Vertices. This avoids constant calls to new/delete and avoids
	fragmentation.

	Based on Guibus and Stolfi's quad-edge stucture and the code presented in Graphics Gems IV (Paul S. Heckbert).
