/*
	This implementation actually supports clipping any polygon - convex or concave (so long as its simple...and in fact it might even work for non-
	simple polygons, but I'm not sure). The only constraint is that the clipping region be a closed convex polygon (ie triangle). It handles any case
	of verticle lines while correctly finding all z values through linear interpolation along edges.

	Effectively, the following function will allow clipping an arbitrarily defined 3D polygon defined as a closed (first and last point equal) vector 
	of Points to any convex 2D region extruded upwards to infinity.

	Note that the convex_region MUST be defined CCW.
	The polygon doesn't have to be a particular orientation CCW or CW are fine, but it will return the orientation it was given.
		
	If the convex_region is defined CW this algorithm will actually result in computing the intersection of the diference of the polygon with each half-plane.
	Mathematically, since the convex_region is convex, that means that the funcation will always return nothing (empty vector). Its possible to prove this
	mathematically and is actually the basis for many point in convex polygon detection systems.
