/*! \brief Cartesean Grid

	Provides an interface for a cartesean grid, may be used to represent a 3D surface, or the isovalues of a volume
	along a plane. Origin must be at the bottom left.
	
	U and V are vectors representing the two directions of the grid (traditionally x and y). Their lengths are the 
	dimensions of a single grid cell. By customizing which U and V to use, a non square grid can be generated with
	minimal effort.
