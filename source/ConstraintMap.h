/*!	\class ctl::ConstraintMap ctl/ConstraintMap.h ctl/ConstraintMap.h
	\brief CosntraintMap

	Provides an interface for binding Edges to Constraints. A Constraint is not an actual class or object, only an ID value
	that represents some constraining factor in a DelaunayTriangulation.

	Vertex Binding -

	A Vertex can be bound\

	There are two forms of binding possible to a Vertex. Active and Passive.
	
	Active binding is when a Vertex is bonded directly to a Constraint. Each Constraint can only have ONE actively bonded Vertex.
	Active binding is used to bind a series of Constrained Edges together by identifying at least one of the Vertices of those connected
	Edges (usually the first Vertex of the Constraint). It can also be used by active bind a single Vertex to a single Constraint in the
	case of inserting Constrained Points.

	Passive binding is when a Vertex is bonded indirectly to a Constraint through an Edge. This is equivalent to an Edge being 
	bound to a Constraint and having a Vertex as its origin or destination. Passive binding is a result of tracking Edge binding.


	Edge Binding -

	Only Active Edge binding is supported. There is no way for an Edge to be "Passively" bound. Each Edge can be bound to any number of
	Constraints and all Constraints binding each Edge are tracked (unlike Vertex binding tracking).
