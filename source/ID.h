Provides a structure to maintain the allocation of unique int ID values to ensure keys are
always unique and to ensure the lowest ID values possible are used, so they can also double as index 
values into an array if needed.

The first ID value recieved when calling getID() for the first time after initialization is 0.
When feeID() is called, it places the newly available ID at the top of the stack and will be returned
on the next call to getID().
