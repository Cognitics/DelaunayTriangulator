 *	\brief TIN
 *
 *	Provides a basic TIN data structure.
 *	Stores two Vector lists for points and their normals.
 *	Triangles are stored as a single IDList.
 *		Each 3 consecutive IDs in the list represents the locations of a single triangle's Vertex points inside
 *		the verts and normals lists.
 *	Triangles are stored CCW.
 *	
 *	Triangles can be created using the following code:
 *	
 *	\code
 *	for (int i = 0; i < int(tin.triangles.size()/3); i++)
 *	{
 *		Point a = tin.verts[tin.triangles[i*3 + 0]];
 *		Point b = tin.verts[tin.triangles[i*3 + 1]];
 *		Point c = tin.verts[tin.trianlges[i*3 + 2]];
 *
 *	//	Normals are retrieved the same way, but call tin.normals[] instead of tin.verts[]
 *	//	..insert triangle handing code here
 *	}
 *	\endcode
